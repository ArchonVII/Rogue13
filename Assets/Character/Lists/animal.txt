an army of ants
a colony of bats
a hive of bees
sometimes, beetles make
a flock of beautiful and strange birds
a seasonal group of butterflies
a radiance of cardinals
a town of stray cats
the hatching of tiny caterpillars
a many-legged millipede
every few summers, a hatching of cicadas
a single coyote
an orchestra of crickets
a murder of crows
the neighborhood dog
a flock of white-winged doves
a brace of green and brown ducks 
an entire flock of finches
a small family of foxes
an army of frogs
the littlest garter snake
a transparent gecko
an unkindness of noisy grackles
a cloud of grasshoppers
an occasional seagull
in the summer, a single hawk
the the winter, a kestrel
a loveliness of ladybugs
a large family of mice
a barn owl
a pack of rats
a colony of rabbits
a nursery of raccoons
a large black raven
a dray of squirrels
a mumuration of starlings
a hermitage of tiny thrushes
a knot of loud-voiced toads
a big snapping turtle
the old vulture
a nest of red wasps
a descent of woodpeckers
a chime of wrens
a swarm of yellowjackets
a little family of skunks
a family of voles
a fire-red salamander
a whisker of shrews
a single wide-antlered deer
this one opossum
a host of sparrows
a round of robins
one bold blue-jay
a gathering of geese
